Feature: Security
    In order to make my website visit secure
    As a user
    I need to be logged out after two minutes of inactivity
    Scenario: User is inactive for two minutes after logging in
        Given I am on the dashboard page
        When I wait 125 seconds
		Then I should be forwarded to the Login View
